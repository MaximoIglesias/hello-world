# hello-world
I´m 45 years old, the last 20 I´ve been working on software development.
I like to think about solutions to peoples problems using investigation and analysis.
The last ideas that I had are:
- A trafic planning and organizing system
- A method using celular broadcast messages to find missing persons (like the amber alert but without the needs for a specific message type)
- An app for emergency services when they found someone unconcious to get their vital medical information by scanning any ID.
